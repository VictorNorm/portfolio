            <h2>Cross course report.</h2>
            <p>This was the first project of the year, and this was the first website i've ever built in my life.</p>
            <p>As usual, the aspect of front end development i struggle most with is the design part, the subjectivity
                of
                design makes it a challenging thing to perform well in for me.
                I have mixed feelings about everything I've turned in so far, I'm happy with some aspects and have a
                decent view of a couple of aspects that should have been done differently. There are big improvements
                to be made in general around the site regarding colours, aesthetics and so on.</p>
            <p><strong>Here are some of the updates i've made during the last week.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>-Updated Cart positioning</li>
                <li>-Updated positioning of the hamburger menu when clicked on smaller screens</li>
                <li>-Exporting and importing functions</li>
                <li>-Converted the from locally stored data to data from a headless wordpress</li>
                <li>-Changed the order/visibility of elements on the cart page.</li>
                <li>-Added functionality on the details page allowing the user to view different images.</li>
                <li>-Generated products into different categories based on their gender category.</li>
                <li>-Fixed localstorage functionality.</li>
                <li>-Different smaller aesthetic tweaks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Cart positioning:</strong> The cart used to be hidden inside the nav on smaller screens, now it
                is visible at the top on all screen sizes.</p>
            <p><strong>Hamburger menu:</strong> As per teachers feedback I updated how the hamburger menu works, the
                links will now appear below the header instead of inside it.</p>
            <p><strong>Exporting/importing functions:</strong> This is a helpful way to make the code more dynamic and
                readable, I will
                definitely impliment this earlier in upcoming projects.</p>
            <p><strong>Converted data:</strong> Moving all the data to one place (wordpress database) was a no brainer,
                I was unaware of
                this at the time when I created local data for all my objects. Having it all in one place is easier to
                handle.</p>
            <p><strong>Changed order/visibility:</strong> I updated the order of how the content is shown so that the
                user can now see
                the other image examples at the top of the page when using a small screen size. I think it creates a
                better experience being able to quickly look at all images again if the use would like to.</p>
            <p><strong>Added functionality on details page:</strong> Enabled the user to click on the different
                availible images and view
                them as "primary" image. The reason being a better user experience making it easier to view the product.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Generated products:</strong> Added functionality to filter men's and women's jackets into
                different categories. I
                think the reason here is obvious.</p>
            <p><strong>Local storage functionality: </strong>I ran into a site-breaking problem related to localstorage.
                When nothing was stored everything crashed based on the code that i had. <p>This is where i spent most
                    my time the last weeks, I did my best at trying to figure oput a way around this problem. It took
                    more than a week of thinking and trying different things, I always try to find a solution myself
                    before following a tutorial or guide. In the end I got help from someone and he showed me what his
                    thoughts were about it, it turned out to be a very simple thing, a "null check".</p>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Different smaller tweaks:</strong> There were some small tweaks to be made (possibly many more),
                some
                sections/boxes growing outside of the intended area making it look unappealing.</p>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Knowing what I know now I would do a lot differently in the project.
                Starting with how i structure the javascript, keeping the majority of functions in a separate script. I
                can also improve my naming conventions in CSS probably reducing the amount of code neccessary to achieve
                the same or better results. Even though I'm not entirely happy with my projects there are some parts
                that I think
                are decent, I realise that development is an immense subject which is hard to learn and near impossible
                to master. And the more I learn the more I realise that I don't understand.</p>
