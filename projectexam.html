            <h2>Cross course report.</h2>
            <p>This was the first project of the year, and this was the first website i've ever built in my life.</p>
            <p>As usual the aspect of front end development i struggle most with is the design part, the subjectivity of
                design makes it a challenging thing to perform well in for me.
            I have mixed feelings about everything I've turned in so far, I'm happy with some aspects and have a
                decent view of a couple of aspects that should have been done differently. There are big improvements
                to be made in general around the site regarding colours, aesthetics and so on.</p>
            <p><strong>Here are some of the updates i've made during the last week.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>-Details page functionality</li>
                <li>-Exporting and importing functions</li>
                <li>-Converted the from locally stored data to data from a headless wordpress</li>
                <li>-Changed the order/visibility of elements on the cart page.</li>
                <li>-Added functionality on the cart page allowing the user to view different images.</li>
                <li>-Generated products into different categories based on their gender category.</li>
                <li>-Different smaller aesthetic tweaks.</li>
            </ul>
