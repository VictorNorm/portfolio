            <h2>Project exam 1 report.</h2>
            <p>This was the last project of the year, and the most recent project I've built.</p>
            <p>As usual the aspect of front end development i struggle most with is the design part, the subjectivity of
                design is what makes it a challenging thing to perform well in for me.
                I have mixed feelings about everything I've turned in so far, I'm happy with some aspects and have a
                decent view of a couple of aspects that should have been done differently. There are big improvements
                to be made in general around the site regarding colours, aesthetics and so on.</p>
            <p><strong>Here are some of the updates i've made during the last week.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>-Navbar responsiveness</li>
                <li>-Footer responsiveness</li>
                <li>-Added content to index page</li>
                <li>-Added padding to about-text on smaller screens.</li>
                <li>-Added margin to contact form on smaller screens.</li>
                <li>-Updated show more button using pagination.</li>
                <li>-Removed white space from file names.</li>
                <li>-Different smaller aesthetic tweaks.</li>
                <li>-Changed javascript folder name from "JS" to "js".</li>
                <li>-Updated the title of all pages.</li>
                <li>-Added meta description to specific page.</li>
                <li>-Updated where my "h1:s" were, now everyone is unique.</li>
                <p><strong>Navbar responsiveness:</strong> Changed the navbar to use a hamburger menu for better
                    responsiveness on smaller screens.</p>
                <p><strong>Footer responsiveness:</strong> Changed the flex-direction of the footer for better
                    responsiveness on smaller screens.</p>
                <p><strong>Added content to index page:</strong> Added some text for the index page to make to look more
                    fleshed out.</p>
                <p><strong>Added padding:</strong> Added padding to about-text for better responsiveness on smaller
                    screens.</p>
                <p><strong>Added margin:</strong> Added margin to contact form for better responsiveness on smaller
                    screens.</p>
                <p><strong>Updated show more button:</strong> Updated the functionality of the show more button, which
                    now revolves around displaying results for the next page of results after every click.</p>
                <p><strong>Removed white space from file names:</strong> For obvious reasons.</p>
                <p><strong>Changed javascript folder name:</strong> Changed javascript folder name from "JS" to "js".
                </p>
                <p><strong>Updated title:</strong> Titles across all pages updated and improved, more descriptive.</p>
                <p><strong>Added meta description to specific page:</strong> This was missing.</p>
                <p><strong>Updated h1 usage:</strong> Had used h1 next to the icon at the top of the page, making the h1
                    the same across all pages. Now the h1 is unique as it should be all across the site.</p>
                <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> My apologies for being repetitive in my reports/conclusions, but I'll
                    have to
                    mention it. I would have done things differently with my newly aquired knowledge. I was happy with
                    the carousel until the flawes of it got pointed out by the teacher grading my assignment (which I am
                    thankful for, it was a terrific report).</p>
                <p>The next time I build a carousel it will work differently, I'll try to display everything using
                    objects rather than creating HTML elements and cycling through them.</p>
                <p>I'm a bit displeased that I couldn't find the time in the end to rework the whole carousel. I spent
                    probably to much time on the functionality of the cross course project.</p>
                <p>I'm going to write down a short checklist of all the feedback I've gotten through these three
                    projects we've created, and for the next project I build I will check every part of that list
                    against my current project and make sure that I don't repeat the same mistakes.</p>
                <p>I'm quite surprised how easy it's been for me to miss simple yet crucial parts of the development,
                    such as unique "h1:s" and meta descriptions etc.</p>
                <p>There are also several things I seem to run into that I think that I've solved but then when pointed
                    out gets infuriatingly obvious how wrong I was, an example here would be not using the pagination
                    approach for displaying more blog posts.</p>
