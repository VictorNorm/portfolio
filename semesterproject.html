            <h2>Semester project report.</h2>
            <p>This was the second project of the year, and this was the second website i've ever built in my life.</p>
            <p>As usual the aspect of front end development i struggle most with is the design part, Id like to think
                that this website is more visually appealing than my first project.
                I'm happy with how the coloration, fonts and the hierarchy turned out. There are big improvements
                to be made in general around the site regarding functionality.</p>
            <p><strong>Here are some of the updates i've made during the last week.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>-Fixed bug bug with images stretching in chrome.</li>
                <li>-Fixed disappearance of image on index page</li>
                <li>-Fixed bug with font imports.</li>
                <li>-Removed placeholder text in inputs on the tickets page.</li>
                <li>-Added text on smaller adds on experiences page</li>
                <li>-Changed the structure for the smaller adds removing major stretching issues</li>
                <li>-Different smaller aesthetic tweaks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Fix image bug:</strong> The image on the front page stretched to 3 times the intended height in
                chrome, making the front page look awful</p>
            <p><strong>Fix disappearing image:</strong> The image on the front page vanished completely at lower screen
                sizes</p>
            <p><strong>Fix font bug:</strong> The syntax of the font importation was wrong, fixed this issue.</p>
            <p><strong>Removed placeholder text:</strong> I removed the placeholder text on the tickets page as this
                created unneccessary clutter on the page. There was no need for it.</p>
            <p><strong>Changed add structure:</strong> The adds didn't respond the way I originally intended them to,
                fixed this by making small tweaks, the goal here was to create a more responsive page.</p>
            <p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>The experience of looking back at this project is similar to looking back at
                the first project. There are lots of things that could have been done in more efficient way. For this
                project the CSS is the part that could have improved the most (this is quite obvious since it is the
                biggest part of the project).</p>
            <p>I chose not to add any JS because I felt that time would be better spent improving the other 2 projects.
                Would I have been more efficient in development during this project I would have structured it
                differently. The naming conventions in the CSS i think are quite messy, the whole file could be a lot
                shorter. I think I also could have managed with fewer media queries.</p>
            <p>If I started to make improvements with JS it would result in spending as much time as I did on the whole
                project, it might be that this is what you are after but I didn't percieve it as such.</p>
            <p>Some of the things i know I would have added if I remade the whole project..</p>
            <ul>
                <li>-A fully functional calendar.</li>
                <li>-More fleshed out information about the events at the museum (preferably with videos).</li>
                <li>-Animations for some of the CTA-buttons indicating that an action has been taken/recieved (example:
                    when booking has been succesful)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are still lots more to improve as there always is, but what I've learned from this project is: To
                make something more visually appealing, and most of all: CHECK that it works in different browsers,
                (can't believe I fell into this trap).</p>
